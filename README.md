# Practical Application Assignment - What drives the price of a car?

[Notebook](prompt_II.ipynb)

# Business Objective
#### In this project, we aim to find the factors that are responsible for predicting the price of a used vehicle. These factors could be the model, manufacturing year, manufacturer, region, odometer readings, number of cylinders, etc. We will do so by utilising Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to see the relationship among the factors and price, we will then build Regression machine learning model to predict the price based on the most significant factors that our model identifies and provide us with accurate price prediction.  
# Results & Conclusions
Machine learning models Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression were able to achieve the determination coefficient of around 66%, which is good for such task but can be further improved.
Overall, Fuel type, number of cylinders, manufacturer, year, etc. impacts the price of cars significantly. For example: Cars with Manufacturer as Ferari have higher prices compared to others.
Dealer should focus on cars that are more recent, have good, excellent condition and avoid buying cars that are salvage, missing parts, etc. Dealer should not buy cars with status as 'lein' as it is unsafe and these cars seems to have high prices.
Further improvements can be made by adding more features to the dataset
